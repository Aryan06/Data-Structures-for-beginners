LINKED LIST: 
Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. 
The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. ... 
In Java, LinkedList class implements the list interface.

Advantages.
* Dynamic Size
* Can be easily inserted and deleted

Disadvantages.
*Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. 
So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation.
*****************************************************************************************************
* Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
