A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.

There are different types of data structures:
*Array
*Linked List
*Stack
*Queue
*Binary Tree
*Binary Search Tree
*Heap
*Hashing
*Graph
*Matrix
*Misc

NOTE: We will not do array data structure as arrays are already done in basic java. We will only practice important questions at the end of the tutorial.
